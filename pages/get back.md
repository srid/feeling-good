- **Why** get back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
	- Because it is counter-productive to do anything (including [sussing out](suss out)) whilst feeling bad, as you are likely to go around in circles!

		  [Richard]: What the identity inhabiting this flesh and blood body all those years ago would do is first get back to feeling good and then, and only then, suss out where, when, how, why – and what for – feeling bad happened as experience had shown ‘him’ that ==it was counter-productive to do otherwise==.
		  
		  What ‘he’ always did however, as it was often tempting to just get on with life then, was to examine what it was all about within half-an-hour of getting back to feeling good (while the memory was still fresh) even if it meant sometimes falling back into feeling bad by doing so … else it would crop up again sooner or later.
		  
		  Nothing, but nothing, can be swept under the carpet.

- **Unable** to get back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
	- You simply see how silly it is to waste this only moment of being alive by feeling bad (see below), and if that doesn't work do something to take your mind off the current issue.

		  RESPONDENT No 23: What about when I find out what happened to end [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) and I see that it is silly to keep worrying about it yet that doesn’t stop the worrying and I am not back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
		  
		  RICHARD: Two things immediately leap to mind ... (1) you value feeling worry (a feeling of anxious concern) over [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) (a general sense of well-being) ... and (2) you have not really seen it is silly to feel bad (a general sense of ill-being). What I would suggest, at this point, is to feel the silliness of feeling bad (in this case feeling anxiety) ... then the seeing (as in a realisation) might very well have the desired effect (as in an actualisation) of once more [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]).
		  
		  RESPONDENT: a) I am not able to see the silliness of feeling bad ...
		  
		  RICHARD: Do you comprehend that, although the past was actual when it was happening, it is not actual now and that, although the future will be actual when it does happen, it is not actual now ... that only this moment is actual?
		  
		  If so, do you further comprehend that anytime you felt good/will feel good does not mean a thing if you are not [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) now ... that a remembered occasion/an anticipated occasion pales into insignificance if you are feeling bad now?
		  
		  Furthermore, do you understand that to be living this moment – the only moment you are ever alive – by feeling bad is to be frittering away a vital opportunity to be fully alive ... to totally enjoy and appreciate being what you indubitably are (a sensate creature) whilst you are here on this planet?
		  
		  If so, is it not silly to waste this only moment you are ever alive by feeling bad ... when you could be [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
