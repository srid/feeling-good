  RESPONDENT: If I keep trying to figure it out, I usually feel worse.
  
  RICHARD: I have located the following text:
  
  • [Richard]: ‘(...) any analysing and/or psychologising and/or philosophising whilst one is in the grip of debilitating feelings usually does not achieve much (other than spiralling around and around in varying degrees of despair and despondency or whatever) anyway’.
  
  What the identity inhabiting this flesh and blood body all those years ago would do is first get back to feeling good and then, and only then, suss out where, when, how, why – and what for – feeling bad happened as experience had shown ‘him’ that it was counter-productive to do otherwise.
  
  What ‘he’ always did however, ==as it was often tempting to just get on with life then, was to examine what it was all about within half-an-hour of getting back to feeling good (while the memory was still fresh)== even if it meant sometimes falling back into feeling bad by doing so ... else it would crop up again sooner or later.
  
  Nothing, but nothing, can be swept under the carpet.
