- For success, it is imperative that [[Feeling Good]] takes priority over anything else (any other emotion!) in life
	- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	  RICHARD: [..] you seem to be interested ... but are you interested enough? In fact, are you vitally interested? And ‘vitally interested’ means that peace-on-earth is the ==number one priority in your life== inasmuch that it amounts to a ==fascinated obsession== with your very being. Is your intention to become free of the Human Condition, in this life-time and as this body, ==the over-riding factor in all of your day-to-day dealings==? If this is not the case, then what are you doing with your life? Why settle for second best when all this while the perfect purity of being alive at this moment in time and this place in space is just sitting here – right under your nose – freely available for anyone ==with the gumption to proceed on into their destiny==.

- You can also put everything on a ‘it doesn’t really matter’ basis

	  RICHARD: [..] I could be just as [happy and harmless]([[Feeling Good]]) on bread and water in solitary confinement in some insalubrious penitentiary ... but I would be pretty silly to act or behave in such a way as to occasion that outcome!
	  The ‘I’ that used to inhabit this body did everything possible that ‘I’ could do to blatantly imitate the actual in that ‘I’ endeavoured to be [happy and harmless]([[Feeling Good]]) for as much as is humanly possible. This was achieved by ==putting everything on a ‘it doesn’t really matter’ basis==. That is, ‘I’ would prefer people, things and events to be a particular way, but if it did not turn out like that ... it did not really matter for it was only a preference. ‘I’ chose to no longer give other people – or the weather – the power to make ‘me’ angry ... or irritated ... or even peeved, if that was possible.
