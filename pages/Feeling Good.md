- Aim to **feel good**[^def] as a bottom line each moment **come what may**.
	- To ensure success, make it your [[overriding priority]] in life.
- If you notice a [[diminishment]], first [[get back]] to feeling good. Then, within 30 minutes, [[suss out]] where, when, how, why – and what for – the [[diminishment]] occurred to [[nip it in the bud]] the next time it pops up.
	- As you get good at this, upgrade your practice by [noticing subtler variations](((682d28ca-238d-41ab-8f17-2f1a421d6692))).
- The whole process is extremely simple, and you'll be increasingly feel *better and better*.

	  [Co-Respondent]: ‘I have spent a lot of the last 18 months thinking about actualism, but **the utter simplicity** of it has escaped me. Let me take a snapshot before it flies away again. ==The idea is to spend as much time as possible feeling good, great, excellent or perfect.== The universe itself needs no work, it is already fine. The peak experience shows that when we are okay the universe is perfect beyond compare. Human life can be fantastic. The universe doesn’t need to be improved before people can be happy. All we have to do is eliminate our own misery and malice, which resides right here in the breast (or brain stem)’.

- Footnotes:
	- [^def]: What is 'feeling good'?
		- Feeling good is a general sense of well-being – a **mood**, not an emotion.
		- Feeling good naturally means you are [cheerfully participating]([[appreciation]]) in being here, hence no resentment.
