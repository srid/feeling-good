- Why get back to feeling good?
	- Because it is counter-productive to do anything whilst feeling bad. You are likely to go around in circles!

		  [Richard]: What the identity inhabiting this flesh and blood body all those years ago would do is first get back to feeling good and then, and only then, suss out where, when, how, why – and what for – feeling bad happened as experience had shown ‘him’ that ==it was counter-productive to do otherwise==.
		  
		  What ‘he’ always did however, as it was often tempting to just get on with life then, was to examine what it was all about within half-an-hour of getting back to feeling good (while the memory was still fresh) even if it meant sometimes falling back into feeling bad by doing so … else it would crop up again sooner or later.
		  
		  Nothing, but nothing, can be swept under the carpet.
