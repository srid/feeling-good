  [Richard]: ‘... if ‘I’ am not [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) then ‘I’ have something to look at to find out why. What has happened, between the last time ‘I’ felt good and now? When did ‘I’ feel good last? Five minutes ago? Five hours ago? What happened to end those felicitous feelings? Ahh ... yes: ‘He said that and I ...’. Or: ‘She didn’t do this and I ...’. Or: ‘What I wanted was ...’. Or: ‘I didn’t do ...’. And so on and so on ... one does not have to trace back into one’s childhood ... usually no more than yesterday afternoon at the most [..]. Once the specific moment of ceasing to feel good is ==pin-pointed==, and the silliness of having such an incident as that (no matter what it is) take away one’s enjoyment and appreciation of this only moment of being alive is seen for what it is – usually some habitual reactive response – one is [once more]([[get back]]) [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) ... but with ==a pin-pointed cue== to watch out for next time so as to not have that [trigger off]([[diminishment]]) yet another bout of the same-old same-old. This is called **nipping it in the bud** before it gets out of hand ... with application and diligence and patience and perseverance one soon gets the knack of this and more and more time is spent enjoying and [appreciating]([[appreciation]]) this moment of being alive. And, of course, once one does get the knack of this, one up-levels ‘[feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])’, as a bottom line each moment again, to ‘feeling happy and harmless’ ... and after that to ‘feeling perfect’ ...’

- Nipping in the bud is what minimizes the 'good' and the 'bad' feelings
	- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	  RESPONDENT: When Richard advises people to ‘minimise’ the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ feelings and activate the felicitous feelings what does he really mean by ‘minimise’?
	  
	  RICHARD: He means lessen their grip and reduce both the prevalence and duration of them, through **nipping them in the bud** (via sincere application of the [actualism method]([[Feeling Good]])), before they can get up and running ... thus maximising the amount of time the [felicitous]([[Feeling Good]]) (and innocuous) feelings can remain operating.

- It is vital to do this promptly lest one goes over the same cycle again and again

	  once a feeling (or a mood) gets a grip it is incredibly difficult to claw one’s way out: hence it is far better to **nip it in the bud** before it gets to that stage.
