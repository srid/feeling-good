- A diminishment in the [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]), leading to either feeling neutral or bad.
- As one gets better at this, it becomes possible to notice subtle variations in one's mood (minuscule blips & minor dips) well before any major diminutions.

	  [Richard]: [..] what ‘he’ had twigged to [..] was how it was far, far easier and simpler to stay in a good mood come-what-may – preferably a happy mood of course – than claw ‘his’ way back up to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]), again and again, after having habitually reverted to type.
	  
	  Hence being (affectively) aware, each moment again, of more and more subtle variations in the quality of one’s moment-to-moment enjoyment and [[appreciation]] of being alive/ of being here so as to earlier and earlier pre-empt any potential reversion to type.
	  
	  Also, repeated experience had shown ‘him’ that minor dips in that quality presaged each major diminution – indeed miniscule blips soon became evident even earlier than those minor dips as ‘his’ ability to (affectively) detect subtle variations in the affective tone of mood and temperament became evermore fine-tuned – and the earlier such habituated silliness could be (affectively) discerned the sooner ‘he’ could thus [nip]([[nip it in the bud]]) these instinctual potentialities in the bud.
