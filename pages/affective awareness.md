		- An affective awareness when [[Feeling Good]] is that very (affective) enjoyment in action.
		- This affective awareness is constant inasmuch as [[Feeling Good]] is the resident mode.
		- When there is [[diminishment]], there is affective awareness of that diminishment in the quality of the mood, which in turns engages cognitive attention (to [[get back]])

		  It is important to comprehend that the aim, the goal, of [actualism practice]([[Actualism Method]]) is the enjoyment and [[appreciation]] of being alive right now – at this very moment of being alive and not indefinitely postponed off into some indeterminate future – via the [minimisation]([[nip it in the bud]]) of both the malicious/ sorrowful feelings (the ‘bad’ feelings) and their antidotal loving/ compassionate feelings (the ‘good’ feelings) in concert with the maximisation of the felicitous/ innocuous feelings, and how that (affective) enjoyment and [[appreciation]] *is* the very actualist awareness in action (as distinct from the buddhistic mindfulness, for instance, which requires cognitive engagement). What this means in effect is that, because one cannot help but be aware, each moment again, of even the slightest diminution of that experiential awareness (of that very enjoyment and [[appreciation]] of *feeling* as felicitous/ innocuous as is humanly possible) via *feeling* it diminish, cognitive attentiveness can be freely applied to whatever one is engaged in doing, in one’s moment-to-moment daily life, be it earning a living, reading/ watching various media, studying for examinations, and so on, and so forth.
		  
		  Put simply: for a feeling-being actualism’s awareness (in regards to how one is experiencing this moment of being alive) is an affective awareness.

- An affective awareness is the feeling being's imitation of the actual world's apperceptive awareness

	  [Richard]: An apperceptive awareness of the nuances in the way or manner in which this flesh and blood body operates and functions – **which the awareness of the [actualism method]([[Actualism Method]] seeks to imitate** – whilst interacting with fellow human beings is more than sufficient to conclude what the striking event was a consequence of.
