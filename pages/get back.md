- **How** to get back to feeling good:
	- Trace back to the original trigger
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  RICHARD: If ‘I’ am not feeling good then ‘I’ have something to look at to find out why. What has happened, between the last time ‘I’ felt good and now? When did ‘I’ feel good last? Five minutes ago? Five hours ago? What happened to end those felicitous feelings? Ahh ... yes: ‘He said that and I ...’. Or: ‘She didn’t do this and I ...’. Or: ‘What I wanted was ...’. Or: ‘I didn’t do ...’. And so on and so on ... ==one does not have to trace back into one’s childhood ... usually no more than yesterday afternoon at the most==

	- Establish successivity of the feelings engendered from that point
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  RICHARD: [..]  in order to facilitate the prospect of seeing the fact which will set them free, of both the feeling and the something which supplants the feeling/belief, it is necessary for them to ==ascertain causality== – what it was which triggered off that feeling which changed (such as to bring feeling felicitous/innocuous to an end) – and ==the mechanics of the successivity== which followed (what the feeling changed into and the process whereby that supplantation occurred).
		  
		  [..] To reduce the [[Actualism Method]] to just seeing the silliness of having the prominent feelings which are rare for you (like anger, jealousy, malice) arise – and to then drop them immediately as they begin to do so irrespective of what caused them and at what precise point they started – is to render it indistinguishable from the socialised/acculturated technique of suppressing feelings as dutifully practised by billions of peoples world wide ... with the same lack of effect in regards bringing about peace and harmony.

	- See the silliness of all the above disrupting [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]), which seeing restores [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  Once the specific moment of ceasing to [feel felicitous/innocuous]([[Feeling Good]]) is pin-pointed, and the silliness of having such an incident as that (no matter what it is) [take away]([[diminishment]]) their enjoyment and [[appreciation]] of this only moment of being alive is seen for what it is – usually some habitual reactive response – they can be once more [feeling felicitous/innocuous]([[Feeling Good]]) ... but with a pin-pointed cue to watch out for next time so as to [not have that trigger off]([[nip it in the bud]]) yet another bout of the same-old same-old.
		  
		  This is called [nipping it in the bud]([[nip it in the bud]]) before it gets out of hand – pre-empting an otherwise endless arousal of the feeling (and its succession) through ignorance of what triggers same, each occasion again, for the remainder of their life – and with application and diligence and patience and perseverance they can soon get the knack of this and more and more time is spent enjoying and [[appreciating]] this moment of being alive.

- **Why** get back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
	- Because it is counter-productive to do anything (including [sussing out](suss out)) whilst feeling bad, as you are likely to go around in circles!
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  [Richard]: What the identity inhabiting this flesh and blood body all those years ago would do is first get back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) and then, and only then, [[suss out]] where, when, how, why – and what for – feeling bad happened as experience had shown ‘him’ that ==it was counter-productive to do otherwise==.
		  
		  What ‘he’ always did however, as it was often tempting to just get on with life then, was to examine what it was all about within half-an-hour of getting back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) (while the memory was still fresh) even if it meant sometimes falling back into feeling bad by doing so … else it would crop up again sooner or later.
		  
		  Nothing, but nothing, can be swept under the carpet.

	- One specific way this sort of .. umm ... psychic masturbation operates is via *"analysing and/or psychologising and/or philosophising*"
		- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		  [Richard]: ‘ ... the more one enjoys and [appreciates]([[appreciation]]) being just here right now – to the point of excellence being the norm – the greater the likelihood of a PCE happening ... a grim and/or glum person has no chance whatsoever of allowing the magical event, which indubitably shows where everyone has being going awry, to occur. Plus **any analysing and/or psychologising and/or philosophising whilst one is in the grip of debilitating feelings usually does not achieve much (other than spiralling around and around in varying degrees of despair and despondency or whatever) anyway**.
		  The wide and wondrous path to an actual freedom from the human condition is marked by enjoyment and [appreciation]([[appreciation]]) – the sheer delight of being as [happy]([[Feeling Good]]) and harmless as is humanly possible whilst remaining a ‘self’ – and the slightest [[diminishment]] of such felicity and innocuity is a warning signal (a flashing red light as it were) that one has inadvertently wandered off the way.
		  One is thus soon [back on track]([[get back]]) ... and all because of everyday events. [emphasis added]

- **Unable** to get back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
	- You simply see how silly it is to waste this only moment of being alive by feeling bad (see below), and if that doesn't work do something to take your mind off the current issue.

		  RESPONDENT No 23: What about when I find out what happened to end [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) and I see that it is silly to keep worrying about it yet that doesn’t stop the worrying and I am not back to [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
		  
		  RICHARD: Two things immediately leap to mind ... (1) you value feeling worry (a feeling of anxious concern) over [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) (a general sense of well-being) ... and (2) you have not really seen it is silly to feel bad (a general sense of ill-being). What I would suggest, at this point, is to feel the silliness of feeling bad (in this case feeling anxiety) ... then the seeing (as in a realisation) might very well have the desired effect (as in an actualisation) of once more [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]).
		  
		  RESPONDENT: a) I am not able to see the silliness of feeling bad ...
		  
		  RICHARD: Do you comprehend that, although the past was actual when it was happening, it is not actual now and that, although the future will be actual when it does happen, it is not actual now ... that only this moment is actual?
		  
		  If so, do you further comprehend that anytime you felt good/will feel good does not mean a thing if you are not [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]]) now ... that a remembered occasion/an anticipated occasion pales into insignificance if you are feeling bad now?
		  
		  Furthermore, do you understand that to be living this moment – the only moment you are ever alive – by feeling bad is to be frittering away a vital opportunity to be fully alive ... to totally enjoy and [appreciate]([[appreciation]]) being what you indubitably are (a sensate creature) whilst you are here on this planet?
		  
		  If so, is it not silly to waste this only moment you are ever alive by feeling bad ... when you could be [feeling good]([[Feeling Good]])?
