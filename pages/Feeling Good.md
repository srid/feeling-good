- You Could Be Feeling Good All the Time
	- Feeling good is a general sense of well-being – a **mood**, not an emotion.
	- Feeling good naturally means you are cheerfully participating ([[intimately approving]]) in being here, hence no resentment.
- Aim to feel good each moment.
- If you notice a dip, **first [[get back]] to feeling good**. Then, within 30 minutes, **[[suss out]] where, when, how, why – and what for** – the dip occurred to nip it in the bud next time.

  [Co-Respondent]: ‘I have spent a lot of the last 18 months thinking about actualism, but the utter simplicity of it has escaped me. Let me take a snapshot before it flies away again. ==The idea is to spend as much time as possible feeling good, great, excellent or perfect.== The universe itself needs no work, it is already fine. The peak experience shows that when we are okay the universe is perfect beyond compare. Human life can be fantastic. The universe doesn’t need to be improved before people can be happy. All we have to do is eliminate our own misery and malice, which resides right here in the breast (or brain stem)’.
